## Synopsis

This project aims to make the process for obtaining badges for events & projects multilingual. 
Based on CHAOSS D&I standards, integration of multiple languages will help streamline the Badging process to be more simplified and flexible thereby making the process quick and easy-to-follow. 

The repositories for the CHAOSS Badging can be found on github [here](https://github.com/badging).

The mentors for my project are [Matt snell](https://github.com/Nebrethar), [Matt Germonprez](https://github.com/germonprez), [Saleh Abdel Motaal](https://github.com/smotaal). 

## Benefits to the community 

A lot of texts, documentation are written in languages which people don't understand. They find it difficult to communicate the problem they are having because they don't understand the native language in which it was implemented. This project will "automate source content updates for translation" into different languages (https://crowdin.com/features). This would afford applicants translated documentation to better assist them navigate the process. It would also make it possible to render viewer-based localizations for badges.

## Current status of the project 

The CHAOSS Badging project is made up of five repositories, a submission template for badging, Documentation about the Badging project, issues based on D&I badging, source texts `.md` about the event and project guidelines (https://github.com/badging).

## Goal 
Build a Collaborative translation process

This process will handle both the projects and events documentation translation based on the applicants choice from different regions, who are interested in obtaining D&I Badging. This process will validate "the synchronization of source text and translated content to ensure" flexibility with integrated tools (https://crowdin.com/teams/engineering).

## Deliverables 

### Deliverable 1: Bring all content together

Identify and localize contents for translation written in the markdown format in a single repository on Github, this will enable an ideal structure that will be implemented. This model will give the maintainers, reviewers and applicants a way to discuss which contents, documentation needs to be translated, ask questions about the D&I badging translation, and also request more content. 

### Deliverable 2:  Integrate the workflow using Crowdin

After the first deliverable, the workflow needs to be automated using Crowdin. Crowdin is a translation and localization management platform that will integrate the development processes of badging from the repository  into deployable translations on github that will be ready for publication (https://crowdin.com/features).

This automation keeps the source content "up to date for translating [â€¦], and previously-translated content is returned automatically" (https://crowdin.com/teams/engineering).

### Deliverable 3: Document/Scale more repositories 

After deliverable two, it is important to scale more repositories that will have multilingual documentation for a seamless user experience, this helps applicants to get their project/event badge in several languages at once especially in their own specified language. 

The documentation will have a summary of the guidelines and methods involved for applicants and reviewers.

## Expected results 

Part one

To achieve this workflow;

1. Crowdin pricing; The pricing for Crowdin can be classified into 
   - Personal plans (https://crowdin.com/pricing#annual)
![crowdin pricing 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24816990/78518885-958e2f80-77b9-11ea-8ae0-75e4e5cc9138.PNG)

- Organization Plans

For applicants, the micro personal plan is feasible. 

2.  Translation status and project activity
This will enable translators,reviewers, maintainers and proofreaders to become more efficient in providing better translations.  
Also, through voting, the best translation is chosen collaboratively. 

3. Budget planning
This would enable applicants to manage resources effectively, they can also collaborate with other applicants to avoid excessive budgeting. 

4.  Comments and Issues
Maintainers, reviewers will be able to ask questions, this will be in form of a Pull request comment on the file/repository on CHAOSS Badging. They will also get feedback based on each activity and request for more context if need be.

### Why CHAOSS?
I am very much interested in CHAOSS because i really want to make an impact with an open source community and CHAOSS was my best choice. I want to use my skills to develop methodologies, guidelines about how Badging can be accessible to all participants for their projects and events.  CHAOSS D&I mentors have really been helpful making me understand how badging works and the methods involved. It is an honour to work with them.

### Availability 
I will be available full time, 40 hours a week. I will be in contact with the mentors if there are any changes that will take place.  I plan to communicate with the mentors through Zoom calls and Emails.
